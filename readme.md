# Introduction
A discord bot created for fiyunae's community using the discord.py wrapper.
Check fiyunae on [twitch.](https://www.twitch.tv/fiyunae).

## Requirements:
    aiohttp
    async-timeout
    attrs       
    chardet    
    discord.py
    idna
    multidict    
    numpy       
    Pillow       
    python-decouple
    pytz     
    websockets     
    yarl

I don't really advice running this on your own, but if you do you'll have to
execute the "setup.py" script (to be added) and add your own tokens.
I have yet to add a script to create the tables on the databases to save all the
required information, so the challenge and leveling cogs would not function as intended.
