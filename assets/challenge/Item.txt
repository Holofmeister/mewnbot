A star-filled cloak
A curved glass dagger
A bottle of blessed wine
A ring with a blinking eye
A carved horn that only certain people hear
A roll of unbreakable thread
A vial of basilisk poison
A mirror that shows another realm
A pair of gloves you cannot remove
A gem with something evil in it
A box with a heart in it
A pair of boots that make no sound
A silver locket, still empty
A wooden mask
A pair of green glasses
A walking cane with a bird's head handle - it speaks to you
Your father's knife
A belt of holding
Pelt of a black wolf
Several arrows with golden feathers
